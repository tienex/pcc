!
! Hello World in BLISS
!
! This is a simple BLISS program that demonstrates
! basic module structure and routine definitions
!

MODULE hello =
BEGIN

!
! External routine to print a message
! In a real implementation, this would link to the runtime library
!
EXTERNAL ROUTINE print_message;

!
! Main routine
!
GLOBAL ROUTINE main : NOVALUE =
BEGIN
    ! Print hello world message
    print_message()
END;

!
! Print a message to the output
!
ROUTINE print_message : NOVALUE =
BEGIN
    ! In a complete implementation, this would use
    ! BLISS character string primitives (CH$xxx) or
    ! link to C library functions

    ! For now, this is a placeholder showing
    ! BLISS routine structure
    LITERAL message_text = 'Hello, BLISS World!';

    ! This would call runtime library I/O functions
    ! bliss_puts(message_text);
    ! bliss_putcrlf();
END;
