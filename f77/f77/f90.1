.TH F90 1
.SH NAME
f90 \- Fortran 90 compiler (with F66/F77 compatibility)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B f90
[ option ] ... file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I F90
is the UNIX Fortran 90 compiler with F66 and F77 compatibility modes.
It accepts several types of arguments:
.PP
Arguments whose names end with `.f' are taken to be
Fortran 90 source programs (or F66/F77 when using compatibility mode);
they are compiled, and
each object program is left on the file in the current directory
whose name is that of the source with `.o' substituted
for '.f'.
.PP
Arguments whose names end with `.r' or `.e' are taken to be Ratfor or EFL
source programs, respectively; these are first transformed by the
appropriate preprocessor, then compiled by f90.
.PP
In the same way,
arguments whose names end with `.c' or `.s' are taken to be C or assembly source programs
and are compiled or assembled, producing a `.o' file.
.PP
The following options have the same meaning as in
.IR cc (1).
See
.IR ld (1)
for load-time options.
.TP
.B \-c
Suppress loading and produce `.o' files for each source 
file.
.TP
.B \-p
Prepare object files for profiling, see
.IR  prof (1).
.TP
.SM
.B \-O
Invoke an
object-code optimizer.
.TP
.SM
.B \-S
Compile the named programs, and leave the
assembler-language output on corresponding files suffixed `.s'.
(No `.o' is created.).
.TP
.B \-f
Use a floating point interpreter (for PDP11's that lack
11/70-style floating point).
.TP
.BR \-o " output"
Name the final output file
.I output
instead of `a.out'.
.PP
The following options are peculiar to
.IR f90 .
.TP
.SM
.BR \-std=STANDARD
Specify the Fortran standard to use. Valid values are:
.B f66
(Fortran 66),
.B f77
(Fortran 77), and
.B f90
(Fortran 90, default).
This allows the compiler to operate in compatibility mode for older Fortran standards.
.TP
.SM
.BR \-onetrip
Compile DO loops that are performed at least once if reached.
(Fortran 77 DO loops are not performed at all if the upper limit is smaller than the lower limit.)
.TP
.BR \-u
Make the default type of a variable `undefined' rather than using the default Fortran rules.
.TP
.BR \-q
Suppress printing of procedure names during compilation.
.TP
.BR \-C
Compile code to check that subscripts are within declared array bounds.
.TP
.BR \-w
Suppress all warning messages.
If the option is `\-w66', only Fortran 66 compatibility warnings are suppressed.
.TP
.BR \-F
Apply EFL and Ratfor preprocessor to relevant files, put the result in the file
with the suffix changed to `.f', but do not compile.
.TP
.BR \-m
Apply the M4 preprocessor to each `.r' or `.e' file before transforming
it with the Ratfor or EFL preprocessor.
.TP
.TP
.BI \-E x
Use the string
.I x
as an EFL option in processing `.e' files.
.TP
.BI \-R x
Use the string 
.I x
as a Ratfor option in processing `.r' files.
.PP
Other arguments
are taken
to be either loader option arguments, or F90-compatible
object programs, typically produced by an earlier
run,
or perhaps libraries of F90-compatible routines.
These programs, together with the results of any
compilations specified, are loaded (in the order
given) to produce an executable program with name
`a.out'.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by
.I f90
itself are intended to be
self-explanatory.
Occasional messages may be produced by the loader.
.SH BUGS
The Fortran 66 subset of the language has been
exercised extensively;
the newer features have not.
