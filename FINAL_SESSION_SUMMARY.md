# Comprehensive Session Continuation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Session:** Continuation #2 - Exception Handling Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This session successfully implemented **Phase 5: C++ Exception Handling** (syntax and code generation infrastructure) for PCC's C++ compiler, building on the previously completed RAII implementation.

### Key Achievements

✅ **Phase 5.1:** Exception syntax support (try/catch/throw keywords and grammar)
✅ **Phase 5.2:** Code generation infrastructure (stub implementations)
✅ **SEH Library:** Analyzed, partially fixed, and documented
✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive planning and status documents

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Phase 5.1: Exception Handling Syntax Support

**File:** `cc/cxxcom/scan.l` (+3 lines)
- Added `try` → CXX_TRY token
- Added `catch` → CXX_CATCH token
- Added `throw` → CXX_THROW token

**File:** `cc/cxxcom/cgram.y` (+57 lines)
- Added CXX_TRY and CXX_CATCH token declarations
- Added `try_block` grammar rule
- Added `handler_seq` grammar rule (multiple catch blocks)
- Added `handler` grammar rule (individual catch clause)
- Added `exception_declaration` grammar rule (catch parameters)
- Added throw expression rules (both throw expr and re-throw)
- Added type declarations for new non-terminals

**Supported Syntax:**
```cpp
try {
    throw 42;
} catch (int e) {
    // Handle int
} catch (const char* msg) {
    // Handle string
} catch (...) {
    // Catch all
}
```

**Commit:** `a0f44f1` - Add C++ exception handling syntax support (Phase 5.1)

### 2. SEH Library Analysis and Fixes

**Files Modified:**
- `libseh/seh_helpers.h` - Added extern declaration for `_seh_current_exception`
- `libseh/seh_dwarf.c` - Added include for `seh_helpers.h`

**Issues Discovered:**
1. ✅ Fixed: Missing extern declaration (undeclared identifier error)
2. ⚠️ Unresolved: Platform-specific register issues in `seh_context.c`
   - REG_R8 through REG_R15 not defined on all platforms
   - Prevents library from building completely

**Documentation Created:**
- `SEH_LIBRARY_STATUS.md` (265 lines)
  - Complete build issue analysis
  - Platform compatibility matrix
  - Recommended workarounds
  - Future work needed

**Decision:** Proceed with stub implementations, defer full SEH integration

**Commit:** `f565f73` - Fix SEH library declaration issues and document build status

### 3. Phase 5.2: Exception Code Generation Infrastructure

**File:** `cc/cxxcom/cxxcode.c` (+134 lines)

Added four code generation functions with comprehensive documentation:

```c
NODE *cxxtry(NODE *try_body, NODE *handler_seq)
```
- Generates try-catch block setup/teardown
- Documents SEH registration/unregistration process
- Stub emits warning once per compilation

```c
NODE *cxxcatch(NODE *exception_decl, NODE *handler_body)
```
- Generates catch handler matching code
- Documents exception type checking
- Documents exception object extraction

```c
NODE *cxxthrow(NODE *expr)
```
- Generates throw statements
- Handles both `throw expr;` and `throw;` (re-throw)
- Documents exception object allocation and raising

```c
NODE *cxxexception_decl(NODE *type_spec, NODE *declarator)
```
- Processes exception declarations
- Handles catch (Type var), catch (Type), catch (...)
- Prepares for future symbol table integration

**File:** `cc/cxxcom/cgram.y` (+12, -13 lines)
- Connected grammar rules to code generation functions
- Updated try_block to call `cxxtry()`
- Updated handler to call `cxxcatch()`
- Updated exception_declaration to call `cxxexception_decl()`
- Updated throw expressions to call `cxxthrow()`

**File:** `cc/cxxcom/cxxdefs.h` (+6 lines)
- Added function prototypes for all exception handling functions
- Organized under "C++ exception handling (Phase 5)" section

**Commit:** `ab61b45` - Implement exception handling code generation infrastructure (Phase 5.2)

## Technical Architecture

### Exception Handling Code Flow

```
Source Code:           Parser:              Code Gen:           Runtime:
                                                               (Future)
try {                  try_block rule  →   cxxtry()      →    _seh_register()
    throw 42;          throw expr      →   cxxthrow()    →    _seh_raise_exception()
} catch (int e) {      handler rule    →   cxxcatch()    →    [type matching]
    // handle          exception_decl  →   cxxexception_decl()
}                      compoundstmt    →   flend()       →    _seh_unregister()
```

### Integration Points

**Already Complete:**
1. ✅ RAII destructor registration (`cxxregister_dtor()`)
2. ✅ RAII destructor calling (`cxxcall_dtors()`)
3. ✅ Symbol table scope management (`symclear()`)
4. ✅ ABI library for type information

**Ready for Integration:**
1. ⏭️ Call `cxxcall_dtors()` during exception unwinding
2. ⏭️ Use ABI type descriptors for exception matching
3. ⏭️ Link with libseh when library is fixed
4. ⏭️ Generate proper SEH frame setup code

### Stub Implementation Strategy

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Compiler continues to build
- ✅ Architecture clearly defined
- ✅ Integration points identified
- ✅ Easy to replace stubs later
- ✅ Progress on other features not blocked

**Implementation:**
- Functions emit warnings once per compilation
- Proper node cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Comprehensive documentation of full implementation
- Clear TODO comments for SEH integration

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Stub Implementation Approach

**Decision:** Implement stubs instead of waiting for SEH library

**Rationale:**
- SEH library has unresolved platform issues
- Syntax and architecture can be completed independently
- Stubs clearly show what needs implementation
- Progress not blocked on external dependencies

**Impact:**
- ✅ Compiler development continues
- ✅ Architecture is well-defined
- ⏭️ Full implementation deferred

### 2. Statement-Based Code Emission

**Decision:** Use direct code emission instead of tree building

**Rationale:**
- Consistent with existing PCC architecture
- `compoundstmt` uses `flend()` for direct emission
- Exception handlers process after try body
- Simpler integration with existing code

**Impact:**
- ✅ Follows PCC patterns
- ✅ Easier to understand
- ⚠️ Less flexibility for optimization

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

**Decision:** Create extensive documentation (1,589 lines)

**Rationale:**
- Complex feature needs clear roadmap
- Future developers need context
- Integration points must be documented
- Challenges and solutions recorded

**Impact:**
- ✅ Clear understanding of architecture
- ✅ Easy to continue work later
- ✅ Decisions are justified

---

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: SEH Library Build Issues

**Problem:** Platform-specific register macros not available

**Investigation:**
- REG_R8-R15 undefined in seh_context.c
- Affects x86_64 platforms
- Likely glibc version dependent

**Solution:**
- ✅ Documented issue in SEH_LIBRARY_STATUS.md
- ✅ Proposed fixes (platform detection, fallbacks)
- ✅ Proceeded with stub implementations
- ⏭️ Full fix deferred to future work

### Challenge 2: Grammar Integration

**Problem:** compoundstmt emits code via flend(), not tree building

**Investigation:**
- Tried passing compoundstmt to code gen functions
- Type errors occurred
- Realized code already emitted

**Solution:**
- ✅ Pass NIL instead of compoundstmt
- ✅ Add comments explaining code flow
- ✅ Focus on setup/teardown hooks
- ✅ Handler sequence still processed

### Challenge 3: Balancing Progress vs Completeness

**Problem:** Should we wait for SEH library or proceed?

**Analysis:**
- SEH library fixes require platform-specific work
- Syntax and architecture can be completed independently
- Stubs provide clear path forward
- Other C++ features also need work

**Decision:**
- ✅ Complete syntax (Phase 5.1)
- ✅ Complete architecture (Phase 5.2)
- ✅ Document thoroughly
- ⏭️ Defer full implementation
