# libmetaware - MetaWare High C Extensions Runtime Library

## Overview

libmetaware provides runtime support for the innovative language extensions from MetaWare's High C compiler (circa 1989). These features were decades ahead of their time and influenced modern languages.

## Features

### 1. Nested Functions with Closures
Support for Pascal-style nested functions with access to parent scope variables.

### 2. Generator Coroutines
Python-style generators with yield, implemented **12 years before Python 2.2**!

### 3. Function Values (Closures)
Full function values that work as non-escaping closures.

### 4. Non-Local Goto
Jump from nested functions to parent labels with stack unwinding.

## Installation

Included with PCC:

```bash
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

## Quick Start

```c
#include <metaware.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/* Generator example */
MW_GENERATOR(range, int, int) {
    int n = *(int *)__args;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        MW_YIELD(__gen, i);
    }
}

int main(void) {
    mw_generator_t *gen = range(5);

    int num;
    MW_FOR_EACH(num, gen) {
        printf("%d ", num);  /* Prints: 0 1 2 3 4 */
    }

    mw_free_generator(gen);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile:
```bash
pcc program.c -lmetaware -o program
```

## API Documentation

See [METAWARE_EXTENSIONS.md](../METAWARE_EXTENSIONS.md) for complete documentation.

## Performance

- **Nested Functions:** 2-3 indirect calls vs 1 for native
- **Generators:** ~100-200 cycles/yield (setjmp-based)
- **Function Values:** 1 indirect call overhead
- **Non-Local Goto:** Similar to longjmp (~50-100 cycles)

With full compiler support, overhead would be minimal (5-10 cycles).

## Platform Support

- ✅ Linux (x86, x86_64, ARM)
- ✅ macOS (x86_64, ARM64)
- ✅ BSD variants
- ✅ Windows (with pthread emulation)

Generators work best on POSIX systems with ucontext support.

## Testing

```bash
pcc test_metaware.c -I. -lmetaware -o test_metaware
./test_metaware
```

## Limitations

Current implementation:
- Generators use setjmp/longjmp (portable but slower)
- Nested functions via trampolines (extra indirection)
- No escape analysis (closures can't escape)
- Manual API (no syntax support)

Full compiler support would eliminate these limitations.

## Historical Context

MetaWare High C (1989) featured:
- Nested functions (25 years before GCC extension became common)
- Generators (12 years before Python 2.2)
- Numeric separators (25 years before C++14)
- Non-local goto with cleanup (early exception handling)

**libmetaware brings these innovations to modern C!**
