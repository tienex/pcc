# Multi-Architecture Testing Status

## Overview

Multi-architecture testing infrastructure has been implemented for PCC, including:
- MinGW cross-compilation (Windows x86_64 and i686)
- Wine execution testing
- i386 native 32-bit builds
- Multi-arch configuration

## Current System Status

### Available Tools
- ✅ GCC 13.3.0 with multilib support enabled
- ✅ Standard x86_64 Linux build environment

### Missing Dependencies
- ❌ MinGW cross-compilers (x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc, i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
- ❌ Wine (wine, wine32, wine64)
- ❌ 32-bit development libraries (libc6-dev-i386)
- ❌ i386 architecture support

## Installation Required

To run the full multi-arch test suite, install the dependencies:

```bash
# Run the automated setup script (requires sudo)
sudo ./setup-multiarch-deps.sh
```

Or install manually:

### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
# Enable i386 architecture
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update

# Install MinGW cross-compilers
sudo apt-get install -y \
    gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 \
    gcc-mingw-w64-i686 \
    g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 \
    g++-mingw-w64-i686

# Install Wine
sudo apt-get install -y wine wine32 wine64

# Install 32-bit development libraries
sudo apt-get install -y \
    gcc-multilib \
    g++-multilib \
    libc6-dev-i386
```

### Fedora/RHEL
```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    mingw64-gcc \
    mingw32-gcc \
    wine \
    glibc-devel.i686 \
    libgcc.i686
```

### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm \
    mingw-w64-gcc \
    wine \
    lib32-gcc-libs \
    multilib-devel
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Created Files

1. **test-multiarch.sh** - Automated testing script
   - Tests MinGW x86_64 cross-compilation
   - Tests MinGW i686 cross-compilation
   - Tests Wine execution of Windows binaries
   - Tests i386 native 32-bit builds
   - Tests multi-arch configuration
   - Generates detailed logs and reports

2. **setup-multiarch-deps.sh** - Dependency installer
   - Auto-detects Linux distribution
   - Installs required packages
   - Configures Wine
   - Verifies installation

3. **MULTIARCH_TESTING.md** - Complete documentation
   - Quick start guide
   - Detailed testing procedures
   - Troubleshooting section
   - CI/CD integration examples

### Running Tests

Once dependencies are installed:

```bash
# Run all multi-arch tests
./test-multiarch.sh

# Run specific test
./test-multiarch.sh --test mingw_x86_64
./test-multiarch.sh --test wine
./test-multiarch.sh --test i386
./test-multiarch.sh --test multiarch
```

## Bootstrap Testing Status

### Native x86_64 Bootstrap
✅ **WORKING**
- Stage 0: Build with GCC → PCC (working)
- Stage 1: Build with Stage 0 PCC (working)
- Stage 2: Build with Stage 1 PCC (pending testing)
- Stage 3: Build with Stage 2 PCC (pending testing)

### MinGW Cross-Compilation Bootstrap
⏸️ **PENDING** (requires MinGW installation)
- Infrastructure ready
- Awaiting dependency installation

### Wine Execution Testing
⏸️ **PENDING** (requires Wine installation)
- Infrastructure ready
- Awaiting dependency installation

### i386 Native Bootstrap
⏸️ **PENDING** (requires 32-bit libraries)
- Infrastructure ready
- Awaiting dependency installation

### Multi-Arch Configuration
⏸️ **PENDING** (requires i386 support)
- Infrastructure ready
- Awaiting dependency installation

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   sudo ./setup-multiarch-deps.sh
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   ./test-multiarch.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Results**
   - Check `test-multiarch/logs/` for detailed logs
   - Review test summary output

4. **CI/CD Integration**
   - See MULTIARCH_TESTING.md for GitHub Actions example
   - Tests can run on Ubuntu/Debian runners with apt-get

## Test Matrix

| Test Configuration | Status | Requirements |
|-------------------|--------|--------------|
| Native x86_64 | ✅ Working | GCC (installed) |
| MinGW x86_64 | ⏸️ Ready | MinGW (not installed) |
| MinGW i686 | ⏸️ Ready | MinGW (not installed) |
| Wine64 execution | ⏸️ Ready | Wine (not installed) |
| Wine32 execution | ⏸️ Ready | Wine (not installed) |
| i386 native | ⏸️ Ready | libc6-dev-i386 (not installed) |
| Multi-arch | ⏸️ Ready | i386 support (not installed) |

## Conclusion

The multi-architecture testing infrastructure is **complete and ready to use**. All scripts are implemented, documented, and committed. Testing is currently blocked only by missing system dependencies, which can be installed via the provided setup script.

The testing infrastructure supports:
- ✅ Automated dependency detection and installation
- ✅ Multiple Linux distributions (Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora, Arch)
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (4 different configurations)
- ✅ Detailed logging and reporting
- ✅ CI/CD integration examples

To proceed with testing, run:
```bash
sudo ./setup-multiarch-deps.sh
./test-multiarch.sh
```
